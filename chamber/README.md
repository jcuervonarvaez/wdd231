### **User Personas:**
#### Small Business Owner
Pedro is a 72-year-old shoemaker who has run his small local repair shop in ValparaÃ­so for over 50 years. His business is known for its high-quality work and loyal customer base, all built through word of mouth. Although he has heard that promoting his services online could bring in more clients, he has no experience with digital tools and feels overwhelmed by technology. Pedro wants to adapt to the modern world but needs simple, clear guidance to get started without changing the essence of his traditional craft.

#### Young owner of a small business.
Benja is a 22-year-old university student at the Universidad TÃ©cnica Federico Santa MarÃ­a. To help pay for his education, he runs a small art business where he sells custom paintings, caricatures, and realistic drawings. Although talented, Benja struggles to reach a broader audience and connect with people interested in his work. He is eager to improve his business and join a community of young entrepreneurs, but lacks the network and knowledge to promote his services effectively online.

#### New residents or business prospects.
MarÃ­a is a 38-year-old school teacher from QuilpuÃ© who is passionate about finding unique, high-quality furniture. She dislikes mass-produced pieces from big retailers like ParÃ­s, Jumbo, or Falabella, and instead wants to support local artisans. However, she doesnâ€™t know where to find local businesses that offer the kind of personalized furniture sheâ€™s looking for. MarÃ­a is searching for a platform where she can easily discover and connect with local creators who align with her taste and values.
